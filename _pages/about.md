I’m currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Endocrinology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where I’m fortunate to work with Professor Alexander Turchin and Professor Marinka Žitnik on AI-driven clinical research. Starting Fall 2025, I’ll be joining the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma as an Assistant Professor.

My background spans engineering, computer science, and healthcare. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I was advised by Professor Xiaopeng Zhao. Before that, I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics from Lipscomb University, and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Research Interest
======
My research explores how artificial intelligence can support early diagnosis, personalized rehabilitation, and continuous monitoring for individuals with chronic disease. I am particularly interested in building theory-driven, human-centered AI systems that integrate cognitive neuroscience, affective computing, and clinical insights. My current work focuses on:

	•	AI for Early Diagnosis of ADRD: Developing screening tools based on referential communication tasks and language analysis, optimized for accessibility, cultural adaptability, and real-world use by older adults.

	•	Real-time Neurofeedback Rehabilitation: Designing ERP-based neurofeedback systems to enhance cognitive functions such as short-term memory, using EEG signals to deliver personalized, closed-loop visual feedback.

	•	Trustworthy Generative AI for Patient Support: Leveraging large language models and multimodal sensing to interpret cognitive and affective states of PwADRD, with the goal of building responsive AI agents grounded in Theory of Mind.

	•	Explainable Machine Learning in Clinical Contexts: Applying interpretable ML methods to identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., sex-specific trajectories, nutrition) using electronic health records and longitudinal data.
  
	•	Foundations for Personalized Chronic Care: Extending AI architectures to model lifestyle-related variables in chronic diseases such as diabetes, integrating domain knowledge through knowledge graphs and LLMs for decision support.

My long-term vision is to develop an ecosystem of AI-powered tools that dynamically adapt to individual cognitive states, supporting both diagnosis and day-to-day interaction, while ensuring transparency, trust, and equity in clinical AI systems.
